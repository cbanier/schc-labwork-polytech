    "This is part of the material for the lecture given at Polytech' Grenoble on IoT Networks by Quentin Lampin, PhD.\n",

    "\n",
    "- the analysis of a traffic capture between a CoAP client and server using IPv6.\n",
    "- the creation of Compression/Decompression rules for this traffic.\n",
    "- the evaluation of rules built by students using usual Compression metrics.\n",
    "- the study of the underlying trade-offs of building Compression/Decompression rules, including a discussion on rule generalization, rules count and memory. \n",
